This file show cases how to provision a full stack of deployment including an Azure VM, add the environment Delphix, ingest an Oracle dSource, and provision 1 VDB. 

This is a great example of disaster recovery scenarios or showcasing the full power of Delphix.

Note: This example will not work out of the box, by default, as you might not have the same Oracle configuration and the Azure VM is half implementated. Consult the comments within the file for further direction.
